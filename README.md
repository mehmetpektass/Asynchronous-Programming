Asynchronous JavaScript Example
This project contains a simple example to understand how asynchronous operations work in JavaScript. The following code snippets demonstrate asynchronous operations running at different time intervals:

console.log("mehmet");: A simple logging operation that executes during the process.
setTimeout(() => { console.log("1 seconds past") }, 1000);: A timer that logs a message after 1 second.
setTimeout(() => { console.log("999 ms past") }, 999);: A timer that logs a message after 999 milliseconds.
setTimeout(() => { console.log("800 ms past") }),: A timer that logs a message after 800 milliseconds.
setTimeout(() => { console.log("700 ms past") }),: A timer that logs a message after 700 milliseconds.
console.log("pektas"): Another simple logging operation that executes during the process.
